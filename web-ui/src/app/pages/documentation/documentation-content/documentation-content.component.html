<section>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Why is the output limited to 500 sentences?</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>GrETEL is free for students and academic research, but the corpora that are accessible via GrETEL are
            <strong>not meant for distribution</strong>. In other words, we do not have the rights to give out the corpus as a whole.
            If a user would search for a structure with only a
            <code>cat="top"</code> node, they could literally download the whole corpus - which is not the intention of this project. If you would
            like to obtain the raw corpus data (for academic or commercial use), you should contact the

    </div>

    <h2 class="subtitle">For whom is GrETEL intended?</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>GrETEL is designed as a corpus query tool which means that it is useful for anyone who is interested in searching
            through the Lassy Small, CGN, or SoNaR treebanks. The tool is especially useful if you want to look for
            <em>specific linguistic patterns</em> in those corpora.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="subtitle" id="about-corpora">Where can I find more information about the corpora available in GrETEL?
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>GrETEL currently provides access to three corpora: Lassy Small, CGN treebank, and SoNaR treebank. More information
            on these corpora is provided on

                was the first corpus to be supported in GrETEL. It is a one-million words treebank that consists of written data. All of
                its annotations have been manually checked and verified.

    <h2 class="subtitle" id="contact">How can I contact you?</h2>

        <p>This website and this tool were originally developed at the Centre for Computational Linguistics (CCL). The current
            version is developed by the Digital Humanities Lab at Utrecht University. If you have any suggestions, questions,
            or general feedback you are welcome to give us a ring, or send us an email. You can find contact information
            on

    <h2 class="subtitle">Why does XPath generated for SoNaR only have one leading slash, when the code for LASSY and CGN has two?
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>It has to do with how XPath structures work on the one hand, and how we optimised the SoNaR database on the other.
            An XPath pattern that begins with a double slash makes sure that the pattern is searched for in all descendants
            of the current node (or implied root), whereas a single slash restricts the search to its direct children. How
            that difference is relevant for SoNaR has been described in the paper cited below.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">What is new in version 3?</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>In addition to an overall design update, major changes include a more intuitive query builder in the example-based
            search mode and a visualizer for syntax trees that is compatible with all modern browsers. Moreover, the results
            are presented as soon as they are found, so you can browse the matching sentences before the treebank search
            is completed. Furthermore it is possible to query the 500-million word SoNaR treebank in a similar fashion as
            the two one-million word treebanks CGN and LASSY Small.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">What is new in version 4?</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A rewrite of the user interface. Links to results can now be shared and navigation is more flexible, quicker and more reliable.
            The entry of XPATH has been updated with a highlighted editor, performing live validation and showing suggestions.
            It's also possible now to show the context of a search (the preceding and following sentence) for an XPATH-based
            search. We've also added an application for uploading new corpora. Furthermore filtering has been added to be
            able to filter results by metadata. Finally a completely new analysis module has been added allowing the properties
            of syntax nodes to be compared using a graphical interface.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">How are properties analysed?</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Only the properties of the first node matched by an XPATH variable is returned for analysis. For example:</p>

        <p>
            A user searches for
            <code>//node[node]</code>. Two variables are found in this query:
            <code>$node1 = //node</code> and
            <code>$node2 = $node1[node]</code>. A sentence with the following structure would match this query:
        </p>
        <pre>node[np] (node[det] node[noun])</pre>
        <p>The node found for
            <code>$node1</code> will then be
            <code>node[np]</code>. The node found for
            <code>$node2</code> will then be
            <code>node[det]</code>. The properties of
            <code>node[noun]</code> will not be available for analysis using this query. When searching for a more specific structure, this is unlikely
            to occur.</p>
